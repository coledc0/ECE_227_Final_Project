# ECE_227_Final_Project

## Making sure the dataset is ready to use
For ease of use, the twitter data from LINK is included in the github repo, inside the twitter folder, as a zip file. When downloading the files, make sure to unzip twitter.zip and move all files into the twitter folder included in the github repo, so that you do not have to change any twitter related graph loading functions.

## Misc
the main file does not include all the simulations we did, as each of us did different simulations, but they are easy enough to replicate from our description in the paper.

## Installing necessary packages
To install all necessary packages, run the following terminal command:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
if you would like to use the conda env file, you may also run
'''
conda env create -f ece227env.yml
'''
