# ECE_227_Final_Project

## Making sure the dataset is ready to use
For ease of use, the twitter data from LINK is included in the github repo, inside the twitter folder, as a zip file. When downloading the files, make sure to unzip twitter.zip and move all files into the twitter folder included in the github repo, so that you do not have to change any twitter related graph loading functions.

## Misc
The main file does not include all the simulations we did, as each of us did different simulations locally, but they are easy enough to replicate from our description in the paper. All necessary functions are included and documented in the .py files.

## Installing necessary packages
The following commands should suffice to run the code:
conda install networkx
conda install jupyter
conda install scipy
conda install matplotlib
